# Phishing Simulation and Awareness Training – Assignment 7

This repository contains **Assignment 7** of my **CSI‑619 Internship at Internee.pk**, focused on conducting a **Phishing Simulation** to educate users about identifying and avoiding phishing attacks.

---

## 🔹 Objective
The objective of this task is to improve security awareness by demonstrating how phishing attacks work and how users can identify suspicious emails.

---

## 🔹 Phishing Simulation Overview
A phishing simulation is a controlled security exercise designed to test user awareness without causing real harm. It helps organizations understand how users respond to phishing attempts.

---

## 🔹 Tools & Technologies
- GoPhish (Open‑Source Phishing Simulation Framework)
- Sample Phishing Email Templates
- Security Awareness Reporting

---

## 🔹 Simulation Process
1. A sample phishing email was designed for training purposes.
2. The GoPhish framework was used to simulate email delivery.
3. User interaction data was analyzed to evaluate awareness.
4. Results were documented in a security awareness report.
